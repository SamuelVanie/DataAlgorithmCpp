* About this repository

I just built this repository as a revision to my course in data algorithms


* How to compile and execute the test

To compile, you do it as a normal compilation but you will need to add *-lgtest* as a compilation flag

The *google test* package need to be downloaded.


Example of compilation :

#+begin_example
g++ Stack.hpp Stack_test.cpp -o Stack -lgtest
#+end_example

A binary called Stack will be generated.
